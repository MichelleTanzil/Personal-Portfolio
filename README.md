# Personal Portfolio

Personal portfolio site for Michelle Tanzil built in December 2019. This site was built 2 months into my developer journey and my first attempt in web design.

# Technologies

- Deployed using firebase

# From the developer:

I'm currently re-building my portfolio site in a different front-end framework - Gatsby, React. Check out the [personal_portfolio_v2 repo](https://github.com/MichelleTanzil/personal_portfolio_v2) for it's progress!
